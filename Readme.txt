First I red the API and other guidelines on your website. Second, I briefly reviewed JavaScript and Node.js.

Next I created an app.js file. This is the main entry point to start the server with node.js.

Then I created different routes for the different tasks. In the future, when I have more time, I would write the different routes in separate classes. These routes take the input from an imaginary front end. I simulate this with the program Insomnia.

Each route calls a function in the service folder. In this folder, each function should have also a separate class, so that in the future, each function from the API that handles the product is in a class. And the same for the other entities. 

Then I wrote the fixed parameters API_Key, port and url in a config file. In the future I would use a json file instead of a js file. 

Finally I tested all the routes and the tasks.

I made these design choices because of a lack of time.At the moment I'm working full time and don't have much time for these tasks.I hope that I can join the internship to improve my knowledge and have the time to do so.
